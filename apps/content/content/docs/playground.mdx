## Local Development

If you prefer working locally, you can clone any playground using the following commands:

```bash
# Clone specific playground environments
npx degit unnoq/orpc/playgrounds/nextjs orpc-nextjs-playground
npx degit unnoq/orpc/playgrounds/openapi orpc-openapi-playground
npx degit unnoq/orpc/playgrounds/contract-openapi orpc-contract-openapi-playground
npx degit unnoq/orpc/playgrounds/expressjs orpc-expressjs-playground
```

For each project, set up the development environment:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

That's it! You can now access the playground at `http://localhost:3000`.
