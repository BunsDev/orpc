Enhance the performance of your oRPC router with lazy-loaded routers.
Lazy routers in oRPC allow you to defer the loading of specific router modules until they're actually needed. 
This can improve startup times and optimize resource usage, especially for large applications.


## Overview 

```typescript twoslash
import { os } from '@orpc/server'

const pub = os.context<{ user?: { id: string } }>()

// Define a router with lazy loading
const router = pub.router({
    lazy: pub.lazy(() => import('examples/server')) // Lazy-load the 'examples/server' router
})

// Use the lazy-loaded router as if it were a regular one
const output = await router.lazy.getting({ name: 'unnoq' })
```

### Key Points:
1. **Export Requirement:**  
   The `examples/server.ts` file must export a router as the default export. Example:  
   ```typescript
   import { os } from '@orpc/server'

   export default os.router({
       // something
   })
   ```

2. **Seamless Functionality:**  
   Once the lazy router is loaded, it behaves exactly like a standard router. You don't need to configure anything extra or worry about limitations.


By using lazy routers, you can keep your application modular and efficient while maintaining the same user-friendly API you're used to.
