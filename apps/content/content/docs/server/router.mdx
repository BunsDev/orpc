## Introduction

A router is a collection of procedures with utilities that help reduce code duplication and improve organization.

```ts
export const appRouter = os.router({
    user: {
        find: findUser,
    },

    nested: os
        .prefix('/users')  // Prefix will be concatenated with paths defined in route(...)
        .use(() => {})     // Apply middleware to all routes in this router
        .router({
            find: findUser,
        }),
})
```

All router functionality is fully typed and begins with the `orpc` instance, providing a consistent and intuitive API.

## Key Features

### Prefixing Routes
You can add a prefix to all routes in a router:

```ts
const userRouter = os
    .prefix('/users')
    .router({
        find: findUserHandler,
        create: createUserHandler,
    })
// Results in routes: /users/find and /users/create
```

### Middleware Application
Apply middleware to all procedures in a router:

```ts
const protectedRouter = os
    .use(authMiddleware)
    .router({
        sensitiveData: getSensitiveDataHandler,
        updateProfile: updateProfileHandler,
    })
// All routes in this router will require authentication
```

### Nested Routers
Create hierarchical route structures:

```ts
const apiRouter = os.router({
    users: userRouter,
    posts: postRouter,
    comments: os.prefix('comments').router(commentRouter),
})
```


## Fundamentals

In oRPC, a router is essentially a nested object of procedures. 
The router syntax provides a convenient way to apply common configurations to multiple procedures:

```ts
const router = os.prefix('/users').router({
    find: findUserHandler,
    create: createUserHandler,
})

// This is equivalent to:

const router = {
    find: findUserHandler.prefix('/users'),
    create: createUserHandler.prefix('/users'),
}

// The same principle applies to middlewares
```
